# Greener

This project has been merged into https://github.com/elmarek/Grean. 

The goal of Grean is to empower community members to take ownership of areas that need to be cleaned up. If a user sees a park or road side that is heavily littered, thay can tag ths area as a project. Events can be created for their neighbors to join and make an impact on their community. 

We foresee this app being used by schools and businesses who are looking to be more involved in their communities and volunteer opportunities.
